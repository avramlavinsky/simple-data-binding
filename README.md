# simple-data-binding
<strong>Super light-weight, stand-alone, incredibly simple utility for two-way data binding.</strong>

<em>Frameworks are fine, but sometimes when you have a nail to drive in, you just want a hammer, not an aircraft carrier.</em>
<p>
Two-way data-binding is a powerful tool.  Ideally, it can eliminate direct DOM references entirely, leading to script which is concise, well organized, and in sync with server-side code.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data-binding has been a key selling point for many JavaScript frameworks, but it shouldn't be sole justification for adopting a framework. Frameworks have their costs.  They are increasingly complex, short-lived, and weighty.
</p>
<p>
Simple Data Binding offers two-way data-binding Ã  la carte.
