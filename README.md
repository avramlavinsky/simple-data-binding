# simple-data-binding
<strong>Light-weight, stand-alone, incredibly simple utility for two-way data binding.</strong>

<em>Frameworks are fine, but sometimes when you have a nail to drive in, you just want a hammer, not an aircraft carrier.</em>
<p>
Two-way data-binding is a powerful tool.  Ideally, it can eliminate direct DOM references entirely, leading to script which is concise, well organized, and in sync with server-side code.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data-binding has been a key selling point for many JavaScript frameworks, but it shouldn't be sole justification for adopting a framework. Frameworks have their costs.  They are increasingly complex, short-lived, and weighty.
</p>
<p>
<em>Simple Data Binding offers two-way data-binding à la carte.</em>

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Dependency-free</strong> – Built in vanilla JavaScript. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Straightforward timing mechanisms</strong> – No polling, no intervals. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Light-weight</strong> – Currently weighing in at 11.4kb (3.8kb zipped) for the full version with live arrays.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Jargon-free</strong> – Simple, meaningful method and property names that don't feel like learning a foreign language. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Intuitive</strong> – Geared towards rapid time to market.  A learning curve that feels comfortable in minutes, not months. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Powerful</strong> – Geared towards advanced form field operations like dynamic options and question branching.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Scaleable</strong> – Performant under conditions that exceed the upper limits of reasonable DOM size and complexity.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Extensible</strong> – Create your own templates, watches and attribute based methods easily for unique data-binding needs and beyond.
  </li>
</ul>
