# simple-data-binding
<strong>Super light-weight, stand-alone, incredibly simple utility for two-way data binding.</strong>

<em>Frameworks are fine, but sometimes when you have a nail to drive in, you just want a hammer, not an aircraft carrier.</em>
<p>
Two-way data-binding is a powerful tool.  Ideally, it can eliminate selectors and direct DOM references entirely, leading to code which is far more concise and better organized.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data-binding has been a key selling point for many JavaScript frameworks, but it shouldn't be sole justification for adopting a framework. Frameworks have their costs.  They are increasingly complex, short-lived, and weighty.

<p>
Simple Data Binding offers two-way data-binding Ã  la carte.

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Dependency-free.</strong> Built in vanilla JavaScript. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Light-weight.</strong> Under one tenth the size of common frameworks.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Jargon-free.</strong> All method and property names easily understood and inherently meaningful. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Intuitive.</strong> Geared towards rapid time to market.  A learning curve that feels comfortable in minutes, not months. 
  </li>
