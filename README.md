# simple-data-binding
Super light-weight, stand-alone, incredibly simple utility for two-way data binding.

<em>Frameworks are fine, but sometimes when you have a nail to drive in, you just want a hammer, not an aircraft carrier.</em>
<p>
Two-way data-binding is a powerful tool.  Ideally, it can eliminate selectors and direct DOM references entirely, leading to code which is far more concise and better organized.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data-binding has been a key selling point for many JavaScript frameworks, but it shouldn't be sufficient justification for adopting a framework.
</p>
The Simple Data Binding project attempts to provide a two-way data-binding with the following requirements:

<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Dependency-free.</strong> Built in vanilla JavaScript. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Light-weight.</strong> Around one tenth the size of common frameworks.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Jargon-free.</strong> All method and property names should be easily understood and inherently meaningful. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Intuitive.</strong> The learning curve should not impede time to market, and uninitiated developers should feel comfortable working with the tool in minutes, not months. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Powerful.</strong> Advanced form field operations like question branching and dynamic options should be easily implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Scaleable.</strong> Performant under conditions that exceed the upper limits of reasonable DOM size and complexity.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Extensible.</strong> Convenient and intuitive methods to extend functionality to unusual data-binding needs and beyond mere data-binding as well.
  </li>
</ul>
