# simple-data-binding
Super light-weight, stand-alone, incredibly simple utility for two-way data binding.

<em>Frameworks are fine, but sometimes when you have a nail to drive in, you just want a hammer, not an aircraft carrier.</em>
<p>
Two-way data-binding is a powerful tool.  Ideally, it can eliminate selectors and direct DOM references entirely, leading to code which is far more concise and better organized.
</p>
<p>
Two-way data-binding has been a key selling point for many JavaScript frameworks, but it shouldn't be sufficient justification for adopting a framework. Frameworks are increasingly complex, short-lived, and weighty. The Simple Data Binding project provides a very different kind of two-way data-binding solution.
